##### -- Leave us alone or join the ash pile.

Ernaut, present. I am the being behind this. I am autistic, and I have sociopathic tendencies; ergo, this may or may not affect how I communicate/interact with thee.

To put it simply, I have often have cannibalistic urges. Frequently I voice out these urges to close friends, usually by way of word, or jests. If you dislike this in any way, shape or form, be cautious when talking to me.

I, Ernaut, am usually seen near the library, café or wandering around. I watch others have their conversations, or I have my own conversations; it is usually the former.

##### -- FREEDOMFOREVER

Before you interact, I wish that these, https://dni-criteria.carrd.co (alongside DSMP), dont apply to you; and I mean this is the vilest way possible.
Secondly, I don't keep entities friended for long; I find myself unfriending most people I interact with, leaving off only one to two people. Apologies in advance.
I am BEGGING you to use tone tags, I am horrid at determining the tone of the conversation through text and in reality. If you wish for me to understand you, I suggest you use tone tags; /j, /hj, and /srs will suffice.

##### -- a more perfect union.

My interests consist of the 𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙪𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙈𝙮𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙨, History ; Austrian and 𝘽𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙨𝙝, Lord of the Flies, CENTAURA, and Classical Music/Music Theory/My Violoncello.
Those in bolded and italicised text are my hyperfixations and special interests.
If you wish to discuss ANY of these topics, please whisper. I'm always happy to share my views on these with people.

##### -- all things truly wicked start from innocence.

Alas, that is the end of this introduction. I bid thee adieu, poor wayfaring stranger.
